I began the conceptual phase of the creative creators form by simply building a basic quadcopter and thinking about the form and dimensions and special functions of my creative creator. With the issue in mind, I realised one of the key advantages this product would have over the bird deterrents is that it is mobile.  This means the processing behind the camera was important. I settled on the Arduino Mega 2560 as it has the greatest amount of processing power. After experimenting with the basic form of my design I began to do more research keeping my target audience and demographic in mind. Before moving on to the next concept.
