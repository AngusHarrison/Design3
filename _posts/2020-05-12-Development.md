Development 2 again focused on trying to increase the effectiveness of the product. Reflective material was added to the front shrouds keeping with the colour palette. Reflective materials have long been used as a form of bird scaring. A water gun and reservoir were also added to the rear of the quadcopter as again water sprayed at birds is a good environmentally friendly way to disperse birds.
